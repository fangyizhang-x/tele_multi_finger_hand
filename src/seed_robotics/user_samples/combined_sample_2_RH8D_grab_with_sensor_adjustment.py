# NOTICE : This sample is the same as the user_sample 7, but with one more threshold than the current, which is the threshold force value mesured by the fingertips sensors

# This sample is done for a RH8D Right Hand
# You can adapt it to a right Hand by changing the 'l' by a 'r' on joint names, and changing the R_ prefixes to ROS Topics by L_ prefixes
# User sample code High Level Logic : When an object is close to the Hand, the fingers close to grab the object. Once it's grabbed, the finger open themselves 5seconds later
# Several things are done here :
# - Get real-time data for each joint
# - Get real-time data from the IR sensor in the palm of the hand
# - Get real-time data from the fingertips pressure sensors
# - Send the instruction to close the index, the ring and the little fingers
# - Send the instruction to close the thumb
# - Continuously checking if any joint is too stressed, i.e. if its current goes above the current limit hardcoded to 300mA
# - Continuously checking if any fingertip sensor goes past the hardcoded force limit set to 1000mN
# - If a joint is too stressed, send an instruction to set its target position to its present position
# - When every joint have their present position equal to their target position -> open the finger and let the object go
